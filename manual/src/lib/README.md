This section of the manual assumes basic familiarity with SAT solving. If
you're new to SAT solving, familiarizing yourself with the command line solver,
described in the previous section, is recommended.

The Varisat library is available on [crates.io as the `varisat`
crate][varisat-crate]. The API documentation can be viewed on [docs.rs].
